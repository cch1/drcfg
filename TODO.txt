## Consolidate metadata into existing ZNode
It's a pain in the ass to have to create both nodes (X and X.metadata).  A tuple of [value, value-metadata, zref-metadata] would solve the problem nicely at the expense of needing a migration.

## Scrap extra scope (just prefix w/ "drcfg", and make that a configurable default)

## Support async calls to zookeeper lib

## Move reporting to separate namespace
 * Use this to get used zrefs: echo wchp | nc 127.0.0.1 2181 | grep drcfg | sort

## Call `removeAllWatches` on ZNode shutdown once server is on version > 3.5.0

## Call `create` on ZNode to return Stat structure once server is on version > 3.5.0
